During programming I'm sometimes looking for an uncommon solution.
Before it becomes realized it is often not needed anymore, because there
is another way to do it, but the idea is still alive and to wants become real.

The result of one similar situation is this module and now it is possible
to have local Class::Data I will use from time to time.

Maybe someone else has a practical use for this too.

This software is free software, but comes without any warrantry.
